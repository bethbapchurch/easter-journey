# Scene 8 - Ministry of Jesus

Jesus told many parables, did many miracles, and spoke to great crowds, to show and explain to people a different way to live.

## The Good Samaritan

When the Samaritan saw a man who had been beaten and robbed, where others had turned away “saying it wasn’t their problem” he took pity on him. He bandaged him and cleaned his wounds. He then put him on the back of his donkey and took him to an innkeeper, whom he paid to look after him. The parable ends with Jesus giving a commandment to go out and do the same as the Samaritan had done.

## The raising of Lazarus from the dead

Lazarus, Martha and Mary were great friends of Jesus. Lazarus died, and everyone came to grieve for him, except Jesus. Although Lazarus had been entombed for four days by the time Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was raised by Jesus from the dead and emerged from the tomb wearing his burial cloths. This miracle, witnessed by many Jews who had come to grieve with the family, inspired many to believe in Jesus as the Christ.

## The calming of the Storm – choose your path

At the end of a day of teaching, Jesus tells his disciples that they should cross to the other side of the sea of Galilee. Jesus falls asleep when suddenly a violent storm sweeps across the sea! The disciples are terrified! But somehow Jesus remained asleep. When Jesus gets woken by the men, he stands up and reaches his hand out to the storm commanding it to be still and quiet. Instantly the wind and waves die down, and the sea is completely calm. “Why are you so afraid? Is your faith in me still so weak?” Jesus asks. The men were so astonished that even the wind and waves obeyed Him!

But many people decide to choose a path that they want to be in control of. Like the Prodigal Son, where the son spent his inheritance, then realised he did not want to live the life he had chosen. He came home where thankfully his father welcomed him back with open arms. Jesus will accept you in the same way – no matter what you’ve done.

## Palm Sunday

_Jesus Christ_ and his _disciples_ travelled to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of _Passover_. They found the road and the sacred city of God overflowing with thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the world. Jesus joins the crowd after instructing his disciples to get a donkey for him to ride on. Eagerly the people made a way for him , they waved palm branches and threw their cloaks on the ground to honor him. The sounds of their praises fill the air. As he made his entrance into Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken. People asked, “What’s going on here? Who is this?” The parade crowd answered, “This is the prophet Jesus, the one from Nazareth in Galilee”.

## Money Changers Story

Jesus went to the Temple, and saw the money changers, along with merchants who were selling animals for sacrifice. Pilgrims carried coins from their hometowns, most bearing the images of Roman emperors or Greek gods, which Temple authorities considered idolatrous. The high priest ordered that only Tyrian shekels would be accepted for the annual half-shekel Temple tax because they contained a higher percentage of silver, so the money changers exchanged unacceptable coins for these shekels. Of course, they extracted a profit, sometimes much more than the law allowed.

Jesus was so filled with anger at the desecration of the _holy place_ that he took some cords and wove them into a small whip. He ran about, knocking over the tables of the money changers, and spilling coins on the ground. He drove the exchangers out of the area, along with the men selling pigeons and cattle. As he cleansed the Temple of greed and profit, Jesus said "My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you make it a den of robbers." The disciples and others present were in awe of Jesus' authority in God's sacred place. His followers remembered a passage from Psalm 69:9: "Zeal for your house will consume me. The common people were impressed by Jesus' teaching, but the chief priests and scribes feared him because of his popularity. They began to plot a way to destroy Jesus.

## The washing of Feet

Jesus was more like a servant than a king! He told people to love their enemies, not destroy them. He echoed the same message God had been sending them for so long “Turn away from sin and give your heart to God”. But people didn’t want to hear him. They put their hands over their ears and hoped he’d go away. The religious leaders hated him the most. They stalked him, looking for any excuse to get him.

The story of Jesus kneeling to the floor and gently washing his disciples feet so they could comfortably dine together is a beautiful picture of his heart of love for us! Jesus cared so very much about the details of his followers' lives! He was willing to get messy to reach, teach, and show undeserved love to his ragtag group of disciples. This is still true today! Jesus cares about even the most minute details of your life and is willing to get messy to show you that you are loved. None of your fears are too small, needs too silly, or stresses too insignificant that God does not care about them. He cares about it all… even our stinky feet! In the story, Jesus washes all of his disciples' feet - they found this strange as they saw him as an important King, not a servant who would do such a task.

He told them, 'Now that I have washed your feet, you can also wash one another's feet. Jesus’s actions in this passage set an example of what it means to imitate him with our lives. We are called to be the servant of others, to live with humility, and love in every situation. Christ-Followers are called to conduct themselves in a very counter-cultural fashion.

## The Last Supper and Whanau Table

Jesus has made arrangements in advance to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem. Jesus was born and brought up Jewish, so it is natural that he should want to remember this festival with his disciples.
Jesus began the Passover in the usual way, but during the meal he made some important changes:

- He broke the bread and passed it to his disciples saying, “Take and eat, for this is my body.”
- He offered them the cup of wine, saying “Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood, which seals God's covenant, my blood poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”

Passover is the meal at the heart of the Old Testament covenant between God and the Israelites. The Israelites are his chosen people, but they must worship Him exclusively. Jesus has taken the bread and wine and given them a new set of instructions for his followers, showing that a new covenant is about to be put in place between God and His people.

It is good to share food with friends, family and strangers – Food is something that unites us all and sitting down to share a meal is one of the simplest, yet most beautiful ways to show you care. In addition to the gorgeous nourishment that food provides, it's a chance to connect with others and take the time to understand what is going on in their world, and to share your burdens. A burden shared is a burden halved.

## Garden of Gethsemane

As the disciples and Jesus finish their supper, they leave the upper room, and head to the Garden of Gethsemane on the Mount of Olives. Jesus asks the disciples to stand guard while he goes alone into the garden to pray. But the disciples fall asleep. He woke them and returns to pray 2 more times, and each time they still fall asleep. He wrestles with God about the suffering that will come. But he decided to faithfully do whatever God chose for him.

## Judas Betrayal

During the last supper, Jesus had announced that one of his disciples would betray him to the authorities. Judas has already made arrangements with the Jewish leaders to do this for 30 silver coins. This shows that Jesus is fully aware of what will happen to him – that he will be arrested and put to death.

Eventually after Jesus was betrayed by one of his closest friends, imprisoned, beaten and humiliated, they decided to kill him. Many people forgot the miracles Jesus had done, the wise teachings he had shared, and called for his death!

Take time now to write a letter to God, telling him how you feel. Post it in the weeping wall, where all the letters will be destroyed.
