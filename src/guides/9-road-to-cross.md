# Scene 9 - Road to the Cross

He was hung on a cross next to two thieves. Jesus’ last words were “It is finished.”

It wasn’t Jesus’ life that was finished – it was God’s plan to save the world from sin. When Jesus died, he died with our sin on his shoulders. And everyone else’s sin too. He became the lamb that replaced Isaac in the story of Abraham. That’s why we call him the Lamb of God. Then they buried him in a tomb.
