# Scene 14 - Distraction

Our own life and time has its own challenges. God wants our undivided devotion, but we live our lives among events and circumstances that take our focus off God and the best life he wants for us.

What is it for you? Money? Toxic relationships? Comparison to others? Busyness? Do you get distracted by scrolling? Be assured that God knows and cares, and he sees it all. Ask yourself what distracts you? What are you running from?

So what about you?

This story that you’ve just heard is still unfolding. It’s a story that you are a character in, like a screenplay. If you follow Jesus, you’re in this story.

You are one of God’s change agents – charged with continuing the story that God started way back at the beginning of the Bible. Writing history with your life!

So take the stage. It’s your call. Step into the lights and carry on the story. Because it’s your story with God.
