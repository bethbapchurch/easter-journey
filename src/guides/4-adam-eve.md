# Scene 4 - Adam & Eve

Like a war that spills from one country to another, the struggle between good and evil spilled onto earth. People began to disobey God. It began with the very first couple that God made. God’s first people – your ancestors – your tupuna – were called Adam and Eve. They lived in a garden called Eden and everything was perfect, until they got tempted to disobey and rebel against God. The Bible calls this rebellion sin. It has serious consequences, for our relationship with God, and our relationship with one another. And it’s been part of our lives ever since. But God has been working on a way out for us.

## Cain and Abel

When Adam and Eve were banished from their home, there was a struggle – evil forces wanting to displace God as the final authority. That battle’s still going on. They had two sons, Cain, and Abel. Both became farmers. Cain grew crops and Abel raised animals. One day they each brought an offering to God. Both offerings were good. Abel really wanted to please God, Cain wanted to look good, but his heart wasn’t in it. God told Cain this. And Cain didn’t like it.

Cain became jealous of his brother because Abel had pleased God. Cain’s jealousy turned into rage, and Cain murdered his brother. Of course, God knew what Cain had done. But even when God challenged Cain, Cain didn’t fess up. Cain made the mistake that lots of us make. He thought that God wouldn’t notice. But God does notice. When God looks at us, he likes what he sees, but not always what we do!
It would be bad enough if Abel’s murder was an isolated incident. But it wasn’t.

**Sin has infected every person ever since. It’s a serious problem, and it needed a serious fix.**
