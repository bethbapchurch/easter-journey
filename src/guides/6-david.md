# Scene 6 - David

The second and most famous king was David – firstly a shepherd boy, then a soldier after defeating a giant called Goliath. He was a musician, poet and someone who really wanted to please God. He was good for Israel as a King.

**But David, as godly as he was, was still capable of serious sin.**

On a hot afternoon, David sees his neighbor’s wife bathing in a courtyard near his house. He calls her in, with one thing in mind. Then, when she becomes pregnant, David plots to kill her husband, who is a soldier in his army. David sets him up to die in battle, so he can marry the woman and cover up his sin.  
But God’s prophet Nathan challenges David to come clean. David makes no excuses.

**He cries out to God for forgiveness, and God forgives him.**

We can learn a lot from David. He tried hard to follow God, and he probably thought that he wasn’t capable of the sin that he committed. But sin can get to all of us. God knew that sin was a bigger problem than any one person could deal with. It’s just as well God had a plan.

It’s important to know that, even though David was forgiven, his behavior echoed through his family for years after, and eventually showed itself in a massive family feud.

**We can be forgiven, but the effects of sin can’t always be erased.** There will always be consequences.

David has another part in the story. Joseph, in the Christmas story – the husband of Mary, the mother of Jesus – was descended from King David.

After David, whenever God’s people talked about the saviour they hoped God would send to save them, they talked about that person being a king like David.

Israel was good for a while after David’s reign, but then it went downhill.

**They never really understood that they were special, that God wanted them as an example for everyone.**

Instead, the Israelites wanted to be like everybody else, worshipping other gods and ripping off the poor. Instead of being change agents, they just blended. Sound familiar?

Eventually Israel was invaded by other countries. Most of God’s people were taken away as captives. Others became refugees. A few stayed in Israel, and some returned when they could, but it was never the same. Israel could never be what God had wanted, because his people were always dominated by enemy rulers.
