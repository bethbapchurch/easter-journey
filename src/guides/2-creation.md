# Scene 2 - Creation of the Universe

Long before the world began, God already was. God never began. He just existed. We don’t know why, but there came a time when God created the universe. Stars , planets, oceans, animals, atoms, electrons and neutrons. And us – people. The bible says that when God looked at what he’d made, he liked what he saw.
