# Scene 12 - Holy Spirit / The Church / The Bible and Paul's Letters

Jesus only stayed on earth about six weeks after his resurrection. Then he returned to Heaven, where God is. Over history, God hasn’t spent much physical time on earth. It’s not because he’s not interested. Since Jesus returned to heaven, God has chosen to work on earth in a new way - an amazing partnership - God’s Holy Spirit working through people. Like you ...

God uses individuals, and also groups. We call them churches.

Churches as in groups of people with a special calling – to love God and love one another, and to make a difference to the whole world!

One of the first churches was begun by Paul, an early Christian leader, very soon after Jesus came back to life. This church was in Corinth, a city famous for corruption and all kinds of religious beliefs. And people being what they are, this corruption spilled into the church.

They started strongly and then got bogged down in strife, with everyone arguing and no-one loving anyone very much.

Paul wrote to them, to try and stop them from arguing all the time and teaching them how to deal with immorality and how to stay true to Jesus. He told them they needed to love one another. If the church has everything else sorted but people don’t love one another, then we really have nothing sorted at all.

Paul also said just how important it is that Jesus came back to life. That if he hadn’t, we’re wasting our time being the church. But with Jesus alive, and still involved, the church is something special. It’s a lot more than just people getting together on Sunday.

The church is a movement – the church in your suburb and the church worldwide is a movement with a purpose – to be God’s people in God’s world, doing God’s work, in God’s power. Moving towards the big finale – where God will restore the creation settings to what he had always intended!
