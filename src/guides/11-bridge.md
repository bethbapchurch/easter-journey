# Scene 11 - Bridge to Life

We can't build a bridge to God, but Jesus Christ is God's bridge to us. Why is Jesus dying on the Cross and rising again such good news for us? It allows us to be with God now on Earth and forever in Heaven because Jesus conquered both our sin and death by dying and rising again.
