# Scene 13 - Armour of God

God gave us a way to protect ourselves. A soldier needs a helmet, shield, and sword. A football player needs his pads, mouthguard, and cleats. A follower of Christ needs protective pieces, too, just not ones that are physically put on. Instead, these gifts are put on spiritually when we are a Christian. Truth, righteousness, the Gospel, faith, salvation, and God’s Word are all must-haves for your daily walk. So, each day after you put on your t-shirt and pants, don’t forget to dress with God’s armour. Equipping yourself with this spiritual armour makes you ready to face the day.
