# Scene 10 - Resurrection

For three days it seemed like God’s great plan was an epic failure. This solution to the world’s sin, planned way back before Abraham, seemed to be dead.

But in the greatest miracle of all time, God brought Jesus back to life.

Jesus was given a new life that would never die again. That’s really important because the Bible tells us that Jesus is just the first of many who will be brought back to life in this way – including you – if you follow Jesus.

When Jesus rose from the dead, the whole Bible story suddenly made sense. This was the plan that God had been working on all that time. It was a plan that didn’t just look back in history. It also looked forward – 2,000 years and more – to us. When Jesus died on the cross, you were already in God’s plans.
