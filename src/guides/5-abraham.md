# Scene 5 - Abraham & Sarah, Issac, Slavery, Egypt and the Promised Land

God’s “fix” was a bold plan to save us from ourselves, and from sin and to restore the world to its original state. It was a long term plan, and it involved his Son Jesus. Jesus didn’t actually appear here until many years later, but He was in on the plan from the beginning.

God’s plan needed people. So he chose an old couple called Abraham and Sarah, gave them a family and made that family into a nation. God promised Abraham and Sarah that their descendants would be as numerous as the stars in the sky. When God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac, Abraham knew that God had said it would be through Isaac that He would keep His wonderful promise. And he had still chosen to trust and obey God even though it seemed that God couldn’t keep His promise if Isaac were dead. God provided a lamb as a replacement sacrifice, this becomes very relevant later in the story.

It took more than 400 years, and the Israelites spent most of that time as slaves in Egypt. When they were ready, God took the descendants of Abraham out of Egypt, guiding them with a pillar of fire and a pillar of cloud by day. When the Egyptians pursued them, God parted the sea to allow them to cross to the other side safely, killing all the Egyptian soldiers who were chasing them.

God provided food and water, but the Israelites constantly grumbled and moaned – they decided to build a golden calf to idolise instead of God. God instead gave them carved stone tablets with some rules to follow, and instructions on how to build a tabernacle so that they could worship God. God went before them as they battled the local people, including taking the city of Jericho, and God gave them the country which they called Israel. Israel’s first leaders were called judges and God led through them. But Israel rejected God’s leadership and wanted kings. So, God gave them kings.
