# Scene 7 - Birth of Jesus

At the end of the Old Testament – the first part of the Bible – it looks like the whole thing was for nothing. But God hadn’t finished. Not by a long way! He still had a plan to restore his creation back to its original settings – that serious fix to the serious problem.

This is where Jesus – God’s son – comes in. God came to earth in the person of Jesus, to show God’s total love for the people he had made. Jesus came as the saviour the Israelites had waited for. But in their continual search for a warrior king riding in from the east to destroy their Roman oppressors, they completely missed Jesus being born. It happened in a dirty stable amongst farm animals – the first of many disappointments to those who were looking out for a king.
